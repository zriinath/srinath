     <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
     <p>On February 24, 1955, a boy was born. His parents were students and were not married. His father, Abdulfatta Giandali, was originally from Syria, his mother, Joan Schible, was from a strict Catholic family of German immigrants. Father Joan promised to deprive her of everything if she marries Abdulfatta.

A kind doctor took care of Joan: he provided her with shelter, took birth and helped give the child up for adoption. The child was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, living in Silicon Valley. They named the boy Stephen.

Paul Jobs was a mechanical engineer, he loved to repair old cars in his garage and sell them. He introduced his son to the world of technology and design.

From early childhood, Paul tried to convey to Steve a love of mechanics, who, in turn, was impressed by his skill and engineering vein. For example, if the family needed a closet, Paul would make it on his own, allowing Steve to help him in this process.

The Jobs house, like the neighboring houses, was built by Joseph Eichler. These were modern houses with huge floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows. They were thought out to the smallest detail, looked beautiful and were inexpensive. These houses reinforced Steve’s desire for elegant design, where there was nothing superfluous.

“I like it when a thing is beautiful but very functional and inexpensive. This was originally conceived by Apple products. This we tried to achieve with the first Mac. And that was achieved with the iPod. ” Steve Jobs

Later, in high school, Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak, and they quickly became friends, becoming best friends. Wozniak was five years older than Jobs and was already a real “legend” in the field of computers.

“As a rule, it was very difficult for me to explain to people all the subtleties of the devices that I worked on, but Steve grabbed everything on the fly. And I immediately liked him. ” Steve Wozniak

In many ways, Jobs and Wozniak were typical boys and loved pranks. But they also loved the world of electronics. They especially liked to experiment and see for themselves what they could do.

Combining their efforts in 1971, they released their first product called “Blue Box” – a device that allowed you to make international and long-distance calls for free. This device imitated the sound of the desired tone, which coincided with the switch signal, which allowed you to switch phone calls.

Wozniak designed this device, and Jobs turned the innovation into a business: parts cost $ 40, and these devices sold for $ 150. They have sold more than 100 blue boxes. Having learned to work together, they realized that they could achieve a lot by combining Wozniak’s engineering knowledge with Jobs’s vision.

Thus, the “blue boxes” laid the foundation for the future of Apple.</p>
